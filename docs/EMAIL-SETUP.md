- ✅ Deploy immediately with current setup
- ✅ Start receiving contact form submissions
- ✅ No additional costs or complexity

### Phase 2: Add Custom Domain (Later)
1. **Buy domain**: `refillplanet.com`
2. **Set up email**: `contact@refillplanet.com`  
3. **Keep Netlify Forms** for simplicity
4. **Optional**: Add auto-reply emails

### Phase 3: Advanced Email Features (Future)
- Automated welcome emails
- Newsletter integration
- Customer support ticketing
- Marketing automation

## Current Form Behavior

When someone submits your contact form:
1. **Form data** → Netlify servers
2. **Netlify** → Sends notification to YOUR email
3. **You respond** from your personal email
4. **Later**: Upgrade to respond from `contact@refillplanet.com`

## Quick Start (No Domain Needed)

Your current setup works perfectly:
```html
<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true">
  <!-- Form submits to Netlify -->
  <!-- You get email notifications -->
  <!-- No domain setup required -->
</form>
```

# Self-Hosted Email Solution - No Third Party Required!

## âœ… WHAT WE BUILT
A complete Node.js email server that:
- âœ… **Handles form submissions directly** - no third-party services
- âœ… **Sends real emails** using just Node.js and nodemailer  
- âœ… **Serves your website** as a complete solution
- âœ… **No monthly fees** or external dependencies
- âœ… **Complete control** over your email system

## ðŸš€ HOW TO SET UP (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/vdatti/Documents/Vamsi\ Personal/RefillPlanet/refill-planet-web-ui
npm install
```

### Step 2: Configure Email
Create a `.env` file with your email settings:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file:
```
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=contact@therefillplanet.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-specific-password
EMAIL_TO=contact@therefillplanet.com
PORT=3000
```

### Step 3: Get App Password (for Gmail)
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
2. Generate an app password for "Mail"
3. Use this password in EMAIL_PASS (not your regular password)

### Step 4: Start the Server
```bash
npm start
```

Your website will be at: http://localhost:3000
Form submissions send emails directly!

## ðŸ“§ HOW IT WORKS

```
User fills form â†’ Your server â†’ Email sent â†’ Your inbox
```

**No Zoho, no Formspree, no third parties!**

1. **User submits form** on your website
2. **Your Node.js server** receives the form data
3. **Nodemailer sends email** using your email account
4. **You receive the email** in your inbox immediately
